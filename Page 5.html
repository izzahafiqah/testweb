  <p align="center" class="pp2">So, on this final page, I‚Äôd want to share with you two of the most unforgettable sequence ever from all three main movies, as well as how I feel about it, as well as<br> the more values from this film, because I want you to know that despite being a cartoon, it teaches us valuable lessons to learn from. <br>So, prepare yourself for an emotional ride!... Or maybe don‚Äôt?</p>

<p align="center" class="pp4">When I saw this moment in the theatre, it almost made me cry (but I swear I‚Äôm not crying!). And I'm the type of person who doesn't easily cry when watching sad sequences in movies,<br> but this is the hardest and saddest moment of the entire film for me. Why? Because I grew up watching this film from beginning to end. I've seen how the relationship between Hiccup <br>and his companion, Toothless, has grown stronger with each film, and they've never been split under any circumstances, but if they do, they always find their way back together. But then there's this scene,<br> with Hiccup sadly letting Toothless go for their own good, and the two of them having to start their lives apart after years together. Even though they are separated by a great distance, <br>yet there are still together‚Ä¶together from afar üß°</p>

	<p align="center" class="pp6">Why the end credit when there are so many other sequences in the movie? What makes it so unique? Well, this sequence brings back a lot of memories for me since they practically <br>mashed together all of the movies into one short scene! From How To Train Your Dragon to How To Train Your Dragon 2 to How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. <br>The franchise came to a fantastic conclusion! I genuinely adore this final scene because it was like saying goodbye to my favourite childhood movie, and I was definitely not ready for it to go,<br> but nothing lasts forever, right? Sometimes you just have to let things go and create memories with it. </p>

	<p class="pp7">For this section, I've listed three values that I've learned through movies.</p>
	<ol type="1" class="pp8" >
	<li>Change is part of growing</li>
		<p>‚ÄúI think that there‚Äôs a few. The biggest one is that change is inherently difficult, but just because it‚Äôs difficult, it‚Äôs not to be avoided, <br>it‚Äôs an inherent part of growing up‚Ä¶ and that nothing worth experiencing comes easy, you know.‚Äù - Jay Baruchel as Hiccup</p>
	<li>You are not who you were yesterday</li>
		<p>To put it another way, we all make mistakes. Every day, we earn something new and (hopefully) use it better ourselves. In the film, Hiccup is haunted by the decisions he‚Äôs made <br>in the past and he wonders if he‚Äôs ready for his new adventure. Hiccup realises that he is no longer as weak as he once was, and that he has the power and courage to continue on with his tribe and dragons</p>
	<li>Real love is unconditional</li>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>In order to become stronger in their separate lives, Hiccup and Toothless must make many sacrifices for one another.</li>
			<li>The resolution between our two main characters teaches us that if you love someone, you must let them go</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
