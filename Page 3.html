<p align="justify" class="p3"> As for this page, I will give you a complete synopsis of all three major films! Yes! This is merely a summary! I made the decision since, after all, who wants to read such a long sentence, right? It'll most likely be boring and hurting your eyes till they want to jump out of their sockets. So, to make things easier for you, I have written a synopsis for you! It's brief, but it's packed with information about the film and each paragraph for each film!</p> 
	
		
	<p align="justify" class="p2">But,  before we go into the synopsis, you should know that there are three primary films in the How To Train Your Dragon franchise: How To Train Your Dragon, How To Train Your Dragon 2, and How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. For an abbreviated form, How To Train Your Dragon can be written as "HTTYD". In the interim, a mini-series will be released to delight fans while waiting for the release of HTTYD 2 and HTTYD The Hidden World. But, because these series aren't fully released in Malaysia, I was only able to watch a few of them. Not to mention the fact that I had no idea how to watch it online at the time. What a miserable life I had back then. Anyway, there are lot of mini-series to mention, but hey, why don't you got visit this website   <a href="https://howtotrainyourdragon.fandom.com/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_Wiki:List_of_episode_userboxes ">here!</a> and look at the entire film timeline!

	<p align="justify" class="p4">To give you a basic rundown of the plot, it starts with a young Viking named Hiccup who is determined to follow his father's legacy and fight the dragons that raid their village. When Hiccup eventually strikes a dragon with the catapult and discovers it crash-landed in the forest, unable to bring himself to kill it. Hiccup quickly realizes that dragons are not at all what the Vikings have always imagined. Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, eventually form a connection that will broaden both of their horizons as the obsevant boy<img src="tumblr_8bbd0a117fd550d4f3a10ec662b52084_0058f73e_1280.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="183" class="img3"/>	
		   discovers that his people have underestimated the species. However, when the two split off in their different ways, they discover that they must battle the harmful ignorance that plagues their world.</p>
		
	<p class="p12">(How To Train Your Dragon 2)</p>  
	
<p align="justify" class="p5">It's been five years since Hiccup and Toothless reunited the dragons and Viking of Berk. While Astrid, Snotlout, and the rest of the gang compete in dragon races (The island's new favourite contact sport), the now-inseparable duo navigates the island's uncharted regions. During one of their escapades, they come across a hidden ice cave full of wild dragons and a mysterious dragon rider who turns out to be Hiccup's long-lost mother, Valka. Hiccup and Toothless are caught in the middle of a battle to protect Berk from a power-hungry warrior named Drago. Now, the two must band together to fight for what they believe in, knowing that only by working together can they influence the destiny of both mankind and dragons.</p>

	<p class="p11">(How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World)</p>
		  
	<p align="justify" class="p6">The Vikings continue to rehabilitate captured dragons in order to bring them to Berk, a thriving dragon and human utopia. As a consequence of their efforts, the island has become overrun with dragons. Hiccup’s ambition to uncover the “Hidden World”, a safe place for dragons mentioned by his late father Stoick, in a response to the overcrowding. Meanwhile, Toothless meets his ideal date in the form of this Light Fury, who was kidnapped by warlords and delivered to renown dragon hunter, Grimmel the Grisly (Night Fury Killer) as bait for him to catch Toothless for use as an alpha by the warlords. The Light Fury, on the other hand, falls in love with Toothless (Night Fury) and teaches him how to control his abilities. After Hiccup and his companions defeated Grimmel in a fight at the end of the film, Hiccup made a tough decision to letting go his buddy to the secret realm, ensuring the dragons’ safety.</p>
