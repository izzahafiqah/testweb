<p align
   ="center" class="p1">Greetings folks! Welcome to my website, where i will be discussing about my all-time favourite childhood movie series!<br>First and foremost, allow me to introduce myself to you! My name is Izzah Afiqah Binti Ruslan to begin with!<br> I'm from group RCS1104D and my matric number is 2020887402. My age is 19, but i will turn 20 in September! I live in Georgetown, Penang and a student at UiTM Arau!</p>	
	
	<p align="center" class="p10">So! For the start of my narrative, the reason I chose this film is that it began with me having an odd fascination with a creature known as a "Dragon". I've always admired this beast since it's enormous,<br>
      can fly, breathes fire, and has a distinctive appearance! And I think that's why I adore How To Train Your Dragon so much! The weird thing is that I have no recollection of how I became<br> interested in this picture. It's like though I'm watching the first film on TV and suddenly BOOM! I'm a newbie that is a tremendous admirer of the film!
Moving on now! The plot of the film is just great! <br>
It is simply that I adore how, from the beginning of the film, the Viking despise the dragons and wanted to kill them, then end up with the Vikings living together with the dragons,&nbsp;<br> to realising their beloved dragon back to their ‚Äúworld‚Äù. Furthermore, the music is the best part of the film since we were able to sense the characters' exact emotion at those unforgettable times by <br>listening to the soundtrack. The soundtrack has a unique feature in that the music conveys the story by itself. I can see, hear, and feel what the Berkians (Vikings who live on Berk) <br>see, hear, and experience. And the music to How To Train Your Dragon is, without a doubt, my all-time favourite! Nothing can persuade me otherwise!
But now that the movie is over, my childhood has <br>
practically ended before my eyes :‚Äô) because it was the last thing from my childhood that lasted that long and life become boring without something from your childhood.</p>
